## Structure Explanation

A common structure for a Flask API with separation of concerns in mind. Each directory serves a specific purpose:

-   **routes/**: Where you define the endpoints of your API.
-   **controllers/**: Handle the direct interaction with the HTTP requests and responses. It deals with the request body, headers, and other related tasks.
-   **services/**: Business logic layer. Operations related to the functionality of the application usually reside here.
-   **repositories/**: Handle the direct interaction with the database. CRUD operations typically reside here.
-   **entities/**: Define the data models (tables) that the application interacts with.
-   **config/**: For database configurations, settings, or any other global configurations.

## Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**:

    Before you begin, ensure you have Python and pip installed. Start by setting up a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    Use pip to install the required packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Database Setup**:

    Make sure to configure your database in `config/database.py` and initialize it.

4. **Run the Application**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to access the API.
